# Ground
The responsibility of SMC at the Saint-Denis Roland Garros airport falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "Roland Garros Ground" (FMEE_GND) on 121.900 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH and Active Runway. **Do not issue a squawk**.

VFR traffic at Réunion are not required to file a flight plan.

    "FOREU, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 14, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Restrictions
