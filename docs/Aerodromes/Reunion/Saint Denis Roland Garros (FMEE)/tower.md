# Tower
The Saint-Denis CTR is controlled by the dedicated ATS unit, "Roland Garros Tower" (FMEE_TWR) on 119.400. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Roland Garros CTR from GND - 6500ft MSL.

!!! note
    The Saint-Denis CTR airspace is designated as Class D, which means that separation services cannot not provided to VFR traffic.

!!! note
    Departure handoffs go to Roland Garros Approach (FMEE_APP) on frequency 127.200. Roland Garros Approach controls the Réunion TMA. 

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft

### Fixed-Wing Aircraft

  * There are no published VFR departure or arrival routings in and out of the Saint-Denis CTR for fixed-wing aircraft. Traffic should instead be asked to report overhead specific visual reporting points. (VRPs)
  * VFR circuits are permitted on both Runways 12/30 and 14/32. The Circuit altitude is 900ft, with circuits away from the terminal buildings.
  * Controllers should avoid extending downwinds significantly to avoid terrain on either side of the field.
  * VFR traffic is not permitted if the cloud ceiling is below 1500ft or if the visibility is less than 5000m.

## Backtracking and Turning Pads

Departing traffic may require a backtrack to make use of the full runway length. It is Roland Garros Tower's responsibility to clear the aircraft onto the runway to perform the backtrack. 

!!! info "Backtrack Clearance"
    FOREU, cleared to enter and backtrack Runway 12, report fully ready for departure. 

## Takeoff Phraseology

!!! info "Takeoff (Full Length)"
    FOREU, Runway 14, wind 080 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff.

!!! info "Takeoff (Intersection)"
    FOREU, Intersection F Runway 12, wind 080 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff.

## Missed Approach

All aircraft are to comply with standard missed approach. Once the aircraft has been observed climbing out again, you may hand off to Roland Garros Approach for further.
