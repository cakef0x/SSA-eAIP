# Delivery

!!! info
    The Saint-Denis Roland Garros airport does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Roland Garros Ground (FMEE_GND).

## Departure Procedures

Pilots shall be issued one of the RNP departures when flying out of Roland Garros. This process is done automatically through the vSID plugin on EuroScope.
Runways 12 and 32 are generally preferred for IFR traffic departures. Runways 14 and 30 can be given upon request to light traffic.

!!! info
    Heavy category aircraft are not permitted to depart from Runways 14 and 30. 

In the event a pilot is unable to comply, one of the conventional SIDs or other means should be issued to the pilot.

**The following SIDs are generally given for departures under IFR.**

**Similar to Mauritius, the Roland Garros TMA is operated procedurally. This means that no squawks are issued with the IFR clearance. Pilots are expected to squawk 2000 when departing from Roland Garros.**

    "Pilots often expect to hear a squawk with the IFR clearance. Pilots shall therefore be notified that the Réunion TMA is operated procedurally and that they are expected to squawk 2000."
