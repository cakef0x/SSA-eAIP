# vATIS Guide

## What is vATIS?
vATIS is an easy-to-use ATIS solution designed specifically for the VATSIM Network. It offers a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to create and broadcast ATIS messages quickly and easily.


Congrats on your new controller rating! To get started on controlling we want to connect an ATIS. An ATIS is a quick way to pass aerodrome information automatically.

!!! warning "VATSIM CoC"

    As per VATSIM CoC C7(a), any ATCS signed on as a Local Local (Tower), Ground, or Clearance Delivery should only provide an ATIS for their primary aerodrome. 
    
    Furthermore, an ATIS can only be connected if the real world counterpart has an ATIS. As a result, vATIS profiles are not made for all airports within our airspace

    More information, and all policies regarding ATIS connection can be found in the [VATSIM Code of Conduct](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/code-of-conduct) and the  [ATC Frequency and Information Management Policy](https://cdn.vatsim.net/policy-documents/VATSIM%20ATC%20Frequency%20and%20Information%20Management%20Policy.pdf)

Our resources page, where you can find the vATIS profiles for all of the South African link can be found [here](https://eaip2.vatssa.com/New-Controllers/Observing%20Guide/TrackAudio%20Guide%20-%20Controller/)
