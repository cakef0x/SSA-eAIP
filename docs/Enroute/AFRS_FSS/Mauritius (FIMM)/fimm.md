## Radar Services

**There are no radar services applicable within the Republic of Mauritius**

## Inbound / Arrival Clearances

On initial call with the pilot, either on HF or VHF, the arrival clearance should be relayed.

For Runway 14, the "E" arrivals are used, i.e. RASMA2E, EPTEK2E, UNPUG1E, etc.

For Runway 32, the "F" arrivals are used, i.e. RASMA2F, EPTEK2F, UNPUG1F, etc.


!!! info "STAR Clearance Phraseology"
    "(callsign), cleared inbound (star) arrival, (current flight level), expect (approach) runway (runway)"

e.g.

**MAU440, cleared inbound TIBAG2E arrival, FL370, expect ILS Z Approach Runway 14.**

At this point, you may also clear the pilot to descend via STAR when ready, and to ask for an estimate at the IAF.

(RWY14) - MP143, IMKOV or EKBAL
(RWY32) - ESTEK

**MAU440, cleared inbound TIBAG2E arrival, FL370, expect ILS Z Approach Runway 14, when ready descend via STAR FL60, request time estimate for IMKOV.**

When handing off to Mauritius APP, pilots are typically asked to report passing FL100 on the descent.

## Handoff Agreement

There is no specified level of agreement detailing a handoff between ACC or APP.

Typically, during Runway 14 operations, aircraft will be told by ACC to descend via the STAR to FL60, if it is the first aircraft in line, and then every other aircraft will be descended with 1000ft separation behind until separation can be guaranteed for the approach.

Runway 32 operations will require prior coordination between APP and ACC to provide adequate separation in a procedural environment between departures and arrivals. In some cases, this may also require extra coordination with TWR to change initial climbs for some outbound aircraft which will be issued at the holding point.

## Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure (SLOP)

!!! note
    **SLOP is applicable between FL290 and FL410 within the Mauritius Flight Information Region.**

- Offsets must only be applied by aircraft with automatic offset tracking capability.

- The offset must only be applied during the enroute phase of flight.

- The offset shall be established at a distance of one or two nautical miles to the right of the centre line relative to the direction of flight.

- The offset must not exceed two nautical miles right of centre line.

- The decision to apply a strategic lateral offset is the responsibility of the flight crew.

- In airspace where the use of lateral offsets has been authorized, pilots are not required to inform Air Traffic Control (ATC) that an offset is being applied.

- Position reports must be based on the current ATC clearance and not the exact coordinates of the offset from track e.g. “Mauritius Centre, Callsign…, position UTIVA 0800 flight level 290, estimate.... etc”.

- The strategic lateral offset procedures have also been designed to include offsets to mitigate the effects of wake turbulence of preceding aircraft. If wake turbulence needs to be avoided, pilot must use one of the three available options (centreline, 1 NM or 2NM right offset). Pilots may contact other aircraft on the air to air frequency, 123.45MHz, as necessary, to coordinate the best wake turbulence offset option. As noted above it is not necessary to notify air traffic control of approved offsets.

- The offset must not be used in addition to diversions or other tactical deviations, e.g. weather deviation.


## Enroute CPDLC / SELCAL

The Mauritius Flight Information Region (FIMM) is equipped and is able to operate enroute CPDLC coverage for aircraft operating above FL195, which is built into the sector files through TopSky, and requires an active Hoppie's Code to use.

**Above FL245, CPDLC is the primary means of communication rather than voice when operating within the FIMM FIR.**

The following instructions can be transmitted via CPDLC.

* Altitude Change (Climb/Descent)
* Heading Instructions
* Direct To (Fix)

As well as this, TopSky offers the following free text options to be transmitted for FACA-W.

* SERVICE TERMINATED. MONITOR UNICOM 122.800
* SERVICE TERMINATED. SQUAWK 2000. MONITOR UNICOM 122.800
* CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS UNAVAILABLE VIA DATALINK. PLEASE MONITOR * VOICE AT ALL TIMES
* CPDLC SERVICE TERMINATED. REVERT TO VOICE
* CPDLC SERVICE TERMINATE PASSING FL195. REVERT TO VOICE.
* RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED.
* ALL ATS TERMINATED.
* RADAR CONTACT LOST.
* NO DELAY EXPECTED.
* DELAY NOT DETERMINED.
* REPORT APPROACHING TOP OF DESCENT ON VOICE.
* REPORT APPROACHING TOP OF DESCENT.
* CHECK STUCK MICROPHONE
* CONTINUE PRESENT HEADING
* RESUME NORMAL SPEED
* REPORT YOUR MACH NUMBER.
* REPORT YOUR IAS.
* REQUEST NOT SUPPORTED VIA DATALINK. REVERT TO VOICE.

There is no SELCAL capabilities within the Cape Town FIR.

!!! info
    All arrival clearances are to be transmitted through voice on initial contact. CPDLC may not be used for this function to issue arrival clearances.
